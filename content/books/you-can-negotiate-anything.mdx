Everything is negotiable. All authority can be challenged. Most people negotiate far less often than they should. Realizing this is a big mental unlock and agency boost.

This book will show you that negotiation is primarily about power, and that you actually have power you don't recognize in most situations. An excellent primer on all the core principles of negotiation, with entertaining real life scenarios to build intuition for each concept.

A concise tactical guide to recruiting. Many useful strategies but lacking the powerful first-principled explanations that made _Fundraising_ so good.

The most useful part are when Ryan provides examples of his individual hiring emails for cold-outreach, people going through the hiring process, offer letters, and messages trying to close executive recruits, as well as little tips for making the process smoother and more positive.

Aside from this, he mainly reiterates standard startup hiring practice without adding extra insight or clarity; the people you hire become the company you build, keep a high bar, don't compromise on it, always be recruiting, intentionally curate culture.

A detailed and engaging biography of Catherine the Great, the empress of Russia, showcasing her rise to power and her significant impact on Russian history.
My Notes:

Key insights:

- Catherine the Great was born in 1729 in Stettin, Prussia, as Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst. 
- First part of the book focuses deeply on explaining the atmosphere of the time and the political situation in Europe. Despite her wealthy upbringing, life was stll incredible mediocre at best.
- She was married to the future Emperor Peter III of Russia, who was a weak and unpopular ruler. After his assassination, Catherine became the empress of Russia in 1762.

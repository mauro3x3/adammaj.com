The most thorough and well written book on the philosophy and history of non-dual Tantra.

Tantra has nothing to do with sex, though it has been completely misconstrued to be associated with it in the West. This book focuses on one non-dual strain of Tantra known as Kashmir Shaivism, which provides a philosophy for enlightened living that emphasizes both liberation and active life, and highlights the beauty of existence and the joy of creation.

The author provides excellent explanations for the entire belief system that indicate his own spiritual understanding and covers the important history behind the tradition.

People who are curious should start with Buddhism or Vedanta instead of Kashmir Shaivism. This book will be most interesting for experienced meditators who are already familiar with non-dualism and looking for a more aesthetic and integrated non-dual philosophy.

Legendary kids fantasy graphic novel series with a plot resembling _The Lord of The Rings_. The first three books combine Jeff Smith's uniquely endearing characters with great storytelling, wordbuilding, and wholesome comedy into an amazing nostalgic reading experience that feels like watching _Avatar The Last Airbender_.

The rest of the series gets less interesting as it plays out a linear plot, falls into standard fantasy tropes, and deviates from Smith's strengths in an attempt to expand its scope. I was unsatisfied with the ending and found it to be inconsistent with the character development of the main cast.

Worth reading for the aesthetic of the Bone world and the incredible first few books, especially if you are familiar with the series from your childhood.

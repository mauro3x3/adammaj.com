An authoritative book on the art of diplomacy, written by the controversial goat of diplomacy himself, Henry Kissinger. Not done yet.

Important insights:

    The book starts off interestingly by focusing on some of my favorite historical figures, Périgord, Metternich and Bismarck.
    The book is a great introduction to the history of diplomacy, and the importance of diplomacy in the modern world.
    A thought provoking quote in Henry Kissinger's analysis suggests that the three major geopolitical forces—China, India, and the United States—lack traditional diplomatic experience for various historical reasons. He argues that:

    China has historically seen itself as a dominant power in East Asia and has focused inward, ignoring much of the rest of the world. This has shaped its approach to diplomacy as largely self-referential and centered on its own region.

    India has a long history of regional division and was not a unified state until relatively recently in its history. This fragmented past impacts its approach to international relations, making it less experienced in the continuous practice of diplomacy.

    The United States developed its foreign policy significantly during the Cold War, a period characterized by ideological conflict with the Soviet Union. This experience was less about traditional balance-of-power diplomacy and more about a binary, adversarial approach focused on ideological and strategic competition."

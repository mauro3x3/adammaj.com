title: Who Are You Really

You are living inside your stories, not the real world. What are you really experiencing?[^1]

You experience light, color, depth. Sound, smell, taste. Texture and temperature. Weight and balance. You feel a sense of up and down. These, and many more, are the sensory aspects of your experience.

You also experience your mind; the impulses, emotions, and memories that arise in your being.

You experience your intellect; the thoughts that emerge, and that you may follow with your awareness, granting them energy and identity, and allowing them to control you.

You may observe your breath. Or you may not, and it will still operate as usual, without your attention. This is the door into your subconscious.

You experience ego, not something to be aware of in itself, but the result of you focusing the energy of your awareness into any object, creating the feeling of identification.

You also experience your will, which guides your movement, speech, and action of all forms.

You experience your knowledge, as it augments the lens through which you view reality. This knowledge manifests as the stories about existence which you identify with.

From here, illusion emerges. You construct a dream world with your knowledge, and you leave reality to live in it.

You identify with these various objects of your experience, granting them the energy of your awareness, and forgetting yourself.

But notice that these are all just objects of your awareness. They are not you, the subject, pure awareness.

When you realize this, you realize the true nature of your one reality. You are simply the subject and the many objects of which it is aware.

All there is is awareness, and the dynamic world that emerges within it.

From here, you can finally appreciate the significance of the most fundamental truth: you exist.

You become disillusioned about the true nature of reality. You know who you really are. And you can reside in the bliss of your awareness.

But this does not mean your existence is false. And it does not mean you should renounce the world.

When you remove illusion, the world still stands. When you see reality through the clear lens of pure awareness, it can no longer harm you. But it still has much to offer you.

From the perspective of pure awareness, the world is full of beauty and remains ever-fresh. The dynamism and complexity of existence is awe inspiring. Your experience always carries with it a joyful richness.

And pure awareness is not just a passive observer. It is active, playful. Creation is innate, but it now comes from a place of fullness rather than emptiness. Your inherent desire to create as an expression of your true nature is the source of art.

The joy of experience and the play of creation are fundamental aspects of your being.

And each object of your experience appears in your awareness as a distinct feeling, an energy.

Your reality is the manifestation of the dynamic selection of energies revealed within awareness.

Your limited capacity to experience energies points to the ultimate awareness and the infinite energies which make up the entirety of existence.

So, your individual experience is a small aspect and expression of the totality of existence, with which you are directly connected.

And this is not something you have to achieve. This is all already who you are, now. Relax into your awareness, and you will realize your true nature.

[^1]: This post is not written with the goal of explanation. It is instead meant as a maximally concise ellaboration of the truth as far as I've validated empirically from my direct experience.<br/><br/>I know that most of this won't make sense initially, especially if you have not been exposed to philosophies like non-dualism, Buddhism, Vedanta, or Kashmir Shaivism, where you can find the inspiration and full explanations for all of these concepts.<br/><br/>This essay serves as a presentation of my current beliefs, and a reference for anyone spiritually curious to investigate these topics and try to further understand them.<br/><br/>Your inevitable skepticism is expected, welcome, and necessary to progress in your understanding of this dimension. I started out skeptical of the entire domain of spiritual exploration, because my perception of it was corrupted by the popularizers with an incomplete understanding of their beliefs.<br/><br/>But I realized that there is an abundance of wisdom to pick up along this path with massive practical consequences, if only you remain skeptical but open-minded, and validate everything through your own experience.

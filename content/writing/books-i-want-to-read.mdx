I am not usually one that thinks New Year resolutions are a good idea. However, I do think that setting goals for the year is a good idea. I have a few books that I want to read this year. I will update this list as I read more books.

Back around New Years I pinned a tweet with all my goals for 2024, one of the goals being reading 12 books.

So here's the list of books I want to read in 2024:

1. Beyond good and evil by Nietzsche (Not started)
2. A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell (Not started)
3. The Prince by Machiavelli (Not started)
4. Reflections on the Revolution in France by Burke (Not started)
5. Rome and Persia 700 years by *** (Not started)
6. The everything store by Brad Stone (DONE)
7. Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (Not started)
8. Skin In The Game by Nassim Taleb (Reading it now)
9. Mediations by Marcus Aurelius (DONE)
10. Diplomacy by Henry Kissinger (Reading it now)
11. Shoe Dog by Phil Knight (DONE)
12. Cathrine The Great by ? (Dropped it)
13. Without their permission by Alexis Ohanian (Dropped it)
14. The Last Question by Isaac Asimov (DONE)
15. The History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides (Not started)
16. Notes from the Underground by Dostoyevsky (Not started, but Dostoyevsky was Nietzscheâ€™s favourite novellist. So I am excited to read this one.)
17. The Hard Thing about Hard Things by Ben Horowitz (Not started)

## anime 
I  have been watching anime since I was a kid. Here are some of my favorite anime of all time:

1) Naruto (I remember back in my middle school we were forced to read a book for an hour everyday in class. My loophole was I would read Naruto manga instead)
2) One Piece (Same as Naruto but was definitely a rarity in Denmark back in the day. I would go manga hunting with my mother through my city)
3) Dragon Ball (DBZ less so)
4) Bleach, never finished it but the Soul Society arc was amazing
5) Shiki (Weird but good)

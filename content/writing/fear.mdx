Why are you so afraid<br />
To take the leap into the unknown

Isn’t a small chance at greatness<br />
Better than the guarantee of mediocrity

How can you be comfortable in your current routine<br />
When you say you want to achieve your full potential<br />
But you’re making no progress toward it

What are you afraid of?<br />
You’re afraid that you’re going to end up a failure?<br />
That everyone will see you as a shell of what you once were?<br />
And yet, in your current state<br />
You are the shell<br />
Of who you could be<br />
But you can’t see that<br />
From where you stand

All it takes is one decision<br />
But you can’t muster the confidence to make it<br />
Constantly deliberating over the possibilities<br />
Enumerating what could go wrong<br />
Projecting failure in every form<br />
Underestimating the abilities that you know you have<br />
Content with the way things are

And you allow this fear<br />
To prevent you from taking the leap<br />
For far too long

But when you finally take the first step<br />
You realize that your fear was misguided<br />
All the time spent paralyzed in fear wasted<br />
With nothing to be afraid of
